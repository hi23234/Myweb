    <h1>Welcome to My Multimedia Webpage</h1>

    <!-- MAIN IMAGE SECTION -->
    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>My Image</h2>
        <img src="myimage.jpg" alt="Rainbow Image">

        <p>
            This is the main image I chose for my webpage. I enjoy taking pictures of the sky whether it is a beautiful sunset or the bright moon. I noticed this particular rainbow after a rainy day at work and decided to capture it. It represents creativity, color,
            and positivity, which matches the overall style of my website.

        <p>
            This video file is an example of multimedia content added to my webpage. I recorded the skies while on a flight to Atlanta and I just could not help but to capture the moment. 
            It demonstrates how video can be embedded and played directly inside an HTML page.

            Your browser does not support the audio element.

        <p>
            This audio clip is included as part of the multimedia requirement. 
            Audio elements add an extra layer of interactivity and personality to a webpage.
